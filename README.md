# Team Profile Generator 

# Project Description 

As a part of my requirements for the UC Berkeley Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, I have developed an application that allows a user to easily produce an HTML page with a roster of their work team. Upon installation, the user is prompted with a number of questions relating to the members of their team. After answering these questions, this software produces an HTML file that contains cards with the information that the user has inputted.
