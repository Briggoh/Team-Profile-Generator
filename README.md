# Team Profile Generator 

# Project Description 

As a part of my requirements for the UC Berkeley Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, I have developed an application that allows a user to easily produce an HTML page with a roster of their work team. Upon installation, the user is prompted with a number of questions relating to the members of their team. After answering these questions, this software produces an HTML file that contains cards with the information that the user has inputted.

2. Upon the successful cloning of this project, open the project folder within your computer's terminal and run the command "npm install"

## Usage

1. Open the main project folder and enter the following command in the terminal to initialize the application: "node index"

2. Answer the questions prompted by the terminal, and check in the "dist" folder to view your newly created HTML file.
